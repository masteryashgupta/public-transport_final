# 📱 Expo Go SDK Version Issue

## The Problem

Your Expo Go app is SDK 54, but the driver app keeps failing with `PlatformConstants` error. This is a version mismatch issue.

## ✅ Quick Solution

You have **3 options**:

### Option 1: Use Expo Go SDK 51 (Recommended) ⭐

**Uninstall current Expo Go and install SDK 51:**

1. **Uninstall Expo Go SDK 54** from your phone
2. **Download Expo Go SDK 51** from:
   - Direct APK: https://expo.dev/go (look for version 2.31.x which is SDK 51)
   - Or wait - I'll create a working version

### Option 2: Create Custom Development Build

This is complex - needs Android Studio or EAS build service.

### Option 3: Simplify to Basic React Native + Expo (No Router)

Let me create a minimal working version that's compatible with your SDK 54.
